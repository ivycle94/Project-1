# PogoBall

I wanted to created a game where you could be an ball and maneuver though obsatcles tight obstacles to collect stars. 

**Instructions**
: The ball will gradually fall due to gravity so the player must keep pressing the jump key to keep the ball stabilized enough to get through the course without touching the obstacles, while also making sure they have collected all the stars.

**Start Screen**
: This screen will display the instructions of the game, and will require the player to press a key to start the game.
